# Modernizing Projects

These are the slides and demos that I used to demonstrate how developers 
can make use of modern projects and tools, but still keep support for the
old, legacy, or maintainence-mode projects. And, to just use new things in
older projects where switching to the latest-and-greatest is not feasible.

## Demos

 * **Demo 1 - PackageReference**  
   A small demo showing what happens when projects are switched from 
   `packages.config` to `<PackageReference>`.
 * **Demo 2 - Old Projects**  
   The big demo project that we will be starting from.
 * **Demo 3 - SDK Style Projects**  
   After switching from traditional projects to SDK-style projects.
 * **Demo 4 - Multitargeting**  
   The demo solution is now just a single projects that uses 
   multitargeting.
 * **Demo 5 - NuGet Pack**  
   The demo project now has a few extra properties and can be used to
   create a NuGet package with `msbuild /t:pack`
 * **Demo 6 - Modern Silverlight**  
   A complete demo of a Silverlight app that can be developed in Visual
   Studio 2017, using all the moder concepts of SDK-style projects, C#
   7.3 and `<PackageReference>`s
   
## Slides

The slides are what I used to present. The are a few notes, but I often 
just wing it with a passion ;)
